Initial Exploration
===================


Quest-Giver Dialog
------------------

Experiment with dialog and common parts of speech (POS) patterns:

* identify corpora that may be useful for this

* generate a small corpora for fantasy/adventure dialog

* identify well-written dialog of this genre and examine POS patterns

* with a view towards a more specialized use, examine the dialogue of "quest
  givers"

  - maybe take translations of Lau Tzu? Socrates? Zen koans?

* look into what NLTK offers for storing only POS

  - not actual words themselves

  - use this to generate unique sentences/dialogues

* classify imperative statements for level of urgency

* start defining lists of "interesting" words

  - use this to generate unique sentences/dialogues


Faction Identification
----------------------

Part of the quest-giving/-accepting process is deciding whether a particular
quest meets one's over-all goals. Often goals are filtered as appropriate by
determining faction association. Not only does one not want to do a quest
for an enemy faction, one wants to protect beneficial faction relationships and
not follow quests that could jeopardize those.

Similarly, if playing in-character, one doesn't want to be inconsistent (for
instance, saving an innocent village in one quest, and then destroying it or
one like it in another).

There are levels of subtlety here, and deception plays a strong part (e.g,
enemies trying to get a hero to violate relationships, agreements, vows, etc.)
in the challenges that face a player... as well as the surprises that can
unfold in a well-written story.

All of these (ane more) need to be examined (psycho)linguistically so that a
game player might have good clues as to the ultimate orientation of a given
faction.
