Initial Exploration
===================


Quest-Giver Dialog
------------------

Experiment with dialog and common parts of speech (POS) patterns:

 * identify corpora that may be useful for this

 * generate a small corpora for fantasy/adventure dialog

 * identify well-written dialog of this genre and examine POS patterns

 * with a view towards a more specialized use, examine the dialogue of "quest
   givers"

   - maybe take translations of Lau Tzu? Socrates? Zen koans?

 * look into what NLTK offers for storing only POS

   - not actual words themselves

   - use this to generate unique sentences/dialogues

 * classify imperative statements for level of urgency

 * start defining lists of "interesting" words
