cweþan
======

This is a project that explores the generation of stories using themed
vocabularies and natural language processing tools.

Project Name
------------

The word *cweþan* (pronounced "quethan") is the Old English verb "to say" or
"to tell." As one might have guessed, a lexical anscestor of this word
partially in use today is the word "quoth." The related Old English noun
*cwyðe* means "the expression of a thought" or "a sentence." Another linguistic
relative is *gegncwide* which means "an answer, retort, or conversation."

As you can see, there is lots of meaning to extract and approprirately apply to
a project whose focus in on words and their arbitrary combination to create
rudimentary but cohesive thoughts with an aim towards eventual
story-generation.


Dependencies
------------

This project makes use of the following tools:

* Python

* NLTK

  * http://nltk.org/

  * https://sites.google.com/site/naturallanguagetoolkit/book

* numpy (NLTK has a dependency on numpy that doesn't always get installed)


Intended Audience
-----------------

Those who might be interested in this code base:

 * authors of interactive fiction

 * creators of text-based games

 * students of social research

 * students of psycholinguistics

Related projects:

* EmotionalModeling

* Myriad Worlds

* DreamMUD


Kicking Off the Project
-----------------------

Here are some thoughts to get the project started:

* what makes a thought or statement interesting?

* what nouns and adjectives draw our attntion?

* what sorts of logical inconsistencies are interpreted as puzzles or riddles?
(As opposed to boring contradiction.)

These questions shall be explored more fully as we begin writing code that
attempts to generate interesting thoughts.

For a detailed list of what's currently being explored, see the TODO_.
